    "# Using Landlab's gradient and flux divergence functions\n",

    "<small>For more Landlab tutorials, click here: <a href=\"https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/tutorials.html\">https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/tutorials.html</a></small>)\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Models of geophysical flow phenomena very commonly include gradient terms and flux divergence terms in their governing equations. Consider the example of conductive heat diffusion in two dimensions. The *flux* of heat, $\\mathbf{q}$, at a point (in energy per time per area) depends on the *gradient* in temperature:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{q} = -k\\nabla T$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T$ is temperature, $k$ is thermal conductivity, and $\\nabla T$ represents the temperature gradient (here in two dimensions):\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\nabla T = \\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can write the heat-flow vector $\\mathbf{q}$ in terms of its $x$ and $y$ components:\n",
    "\n",
    "$q_x = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}$, and\n",
    "\n",
    "$q_y = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where the subscripts on $q$ denote each of the two directions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The time rate of change of thermal energy depends on the derivative of flux, or *flux divergence*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{dT}{dt} \\propto -\\left( \\frac{\\partial q_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial q_y}{\\partial y} \\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a finite-difference or finite-volume solution, the quantities $T$ and $\\mathbf{q}$ are solved at discrete points. Staggered-grid schemes will place the scalar quantity ($T$) at one set of grid locations, and the vector quantity ($\\mathbf{q}$) at \"in-between\" locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Landlab, such a staggered grid is easy to implement by locating scalar quantities at nodes, and locating vector quantities at links. Recall that each link connects a pair of adjacent nodes. Therefore, a link is a natural location at which to calculate and store the gradient in some scalar quantity (like temperature) that is defined on its bounding nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Landlab provides a set of \"one-liner\" functions to calculate the gradients in a quantity located at nodes, as well as to calculate the net flux or flux divergence in a vector quantity located at faces or links. This tutorial shows you examples of how to use these.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with a tiny grid, so it's easy to see what the various flavors of the gradient and flux functions do. Then we'll try them out on the example of a landform undergoing soil creep, which is the same example used in the introductory Landlab \"fault scarp\" tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tiny grid example\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with a 3-row by 4-column raster grid, with 10-meter node spacing."
